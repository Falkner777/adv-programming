# Weather Application

A small GUI-based application for weather information,including weather maps, hourly and weekly forecasts.


Installation process: To install the program you need create a virtual Python environment on your computer. Then within that virtual environment, use pip install -r requirements.txt
in order to download the needed python modules for the application. 
Although not advisable you can do so without a virtual environment by downloading the modules straight to your python files.

To create a virtual environment in windows (VSCode): use python -m venv venv, in the terminal. You will be met with a message asking if you want to use the virtual environment as the workspace
folder. Click "Yes". Open a new terminal and you are now working in the virtual environment.
